The Runway Redeclaration Project has the Following Dependencies:
JRE 	1.8.x	(JavaFX is included in this distribution, jar should run on any JRE)

Running the jar launches the window for the application, where information about an airport and its runways can either be entered or imported via XML files.

The airport configuration can then be displayed, where obstacles can be added and their effect viewed from mutliple angles.
